# Making Your Repository Public

If you're on a free GitHub plan and want to use GitHub Pages, you need to make your repository public:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings"
3. Scroll down to the "Danger Zone" section
4. Click "Change visibility"
5. Select "Make public"
6. Type the repository name to confirm
7. Click "I understand, make this repository public"

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Making your repository public means anyone can view your code.
> 
> If you want to keep your code private but still have a public website, consider:
> 1. Upgrading to GitHub Pro ($4/month)
> 2. Using Netlify or Vercel (both have free tiers that work with private repos)
