## Performance Optimization for Hosting

For the best performance after deploying:

1. **Enable Gzip Compression**
   - Create a `.htaccess` file with compression settings

2. **Set Cache Headers**
   - Add proper cache headers for static assets:
     ```
     # Cache CSS and JS for 1 week
     <FilesMatch "\.(css|js)$">
       Header set Cache-Control "max-age=604800, public"
     </FilesMatch>
     
     # Cache images for 1 month
     <FilesMatch "\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg)$">
       Header set Cache-Control "max-age=2592000, public"
     </FilesMatch>
     ```

3. **Use a CDN for Assets**
   - Consider using Cloudflare's free CDN
   - Or use a paid CDN like Amazon CloudFront

4. **Optimize Image Delivery**
   - Consider services like Cloudinary or ImageKit for automatic image optimization

## Domain Name Setup

1. Purchase a domain from a registrar like Namecheap, Google Domains, or GoDaddy
2. Point your domain to your hosting service:
   - For GitHub Pages: Set up a CNAME record
   - For Netlify/Vercel: Follow their domain connection guides
   - For traditional hosting: Update nameservers or DNS records

## Security Considerations

1. Always use HTTPS (free through Let's Encrypt)
2. Keep all third-party libraries updated
3. Implement Content Security Policy headers
4. If using forms, add CSRF protection

## Monitoring

Consider setting up free monitoring with:
- Google Analytics
- Uptime Robot (free plan available)
- Google Search Console
