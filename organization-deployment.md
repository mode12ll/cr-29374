# Deploying from an Organization Account

As your personal GitHub account is part of an organization (Horizon Films), here's how to properly set up and deploy your car marketplace project:

## Understanding Organization Repository Deployment

When deploying a repository that belongs to an organization:

1. **Permissions Matter**: Ensure you have the right permissions within the organization to deploy GitHub Pages:
   - Admin or Write access to the repository
   - If GitHub Pages deployment is restricted to specific roles, make sure you have that role

2. **Repository Visibility**: With an organization, the repository visibility rules still apply:
   - Public repositories can always use GitHub Pages
   - Private repositories require GitHub Team or Enterprise plan to use GitHub Pages

3. **Deployment Branch**: Organization repositories often have branch protection rules that may affect deployment:
   - Protected branches might require pull requests and reviews
   - You may need to use a specific branch for deployment (e.g., `gh-pages`)

## Step-by-Step Deployment Process

1. **Check Organization Settings**:
   - Go to the organization's main page
   - Click on "Settings"
   - Navigate to "Member privileges" 
   - Check if there are any restrictions on Pages publishing

2. **Repository Setup**:
   - Create or use an existing repository within the organization
   - Clone it to your local machine: 
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/organization-name/car-marketplace.git
     ```

3. **Push Your Code**:
   - Add your files to the repository
   - Commit changes:
     ```
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add car marketplace project"
     ```
   - Push to the organization's repository:
     ```
     git push origin main
     ```

4. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to the repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" in the sidebar
   - Select your source branch (usually `main`)
   - Save the settings

5. **View Your Deployed Site**:
   - The site will be available at: `https://organization-name.github.io/car-marketplace/`
   - Or at your custom domain if configured

## Organization-Specific Features

1. **Team Collaboration**: 
   - Multiple members can contribute to the same repository
   - Set up code owners to require specific reviews

2. **Custom Domain with Verified Domains**:
   - Organizations can verify domain ownership
   - Deploy to verified custom domains with added security

3. **Environment Protection**:
   - Set up deployment environment protection rules
   - Require approvals before site updates go live

## Troubleshooting Organization Deployments

- **Permission Issues**: If your deployment fails, check with an organization admin about your permission level
- **Workflow Failures**: Review the Actions tab for detailed error messages
- **Branch Restrictions**: Ensure you're using an allowed branch for deployment

Remember that organization settings can override personal settings, so when in doubt, check with your organization administrators for specific policies.
