# Setting up GitHub Pages for Your Private Repository

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" in the top menu
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section (now under "Code and automation" > "Pages" in the left sidebar)
4. Under "Source", select either:
   - "Deploy from a branch" (traditional method)
   - OR "GitHub Actions" (newer workflow method)

## For "Deploy from a branch" option:
1. Select the branch you want to deploy (usually "main")
2. Select the folder (usually "/ (root)")
3. Click "Save"
4. Wait a few minutes for the site to build

## For GitHub Actions (recommended):
1. Select "GitHub Actions"
2. Choose the "Static HTML" workflow
3. Commit the workflow file to your repository
4. GitHub will automatically deploy your site

## Important Notes for Private Repositories:
- GitHub Pages is available for private repositories if you're on a GitHub Pro, Team, or Enterprise plan
- If you're using the free plan, your repository must be public to use GitHub Pages
- If you want to keep your code private but still deploy the site, consider using Netlify or Vercel instead
