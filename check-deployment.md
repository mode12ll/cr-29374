# Checking Your GitHub Pages Deployment

Once you've enabled GitHub Pages, you can check the status of your deployment:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Actions" in the top menu
3. You should see a workflow run for "Deploy static content to Pages"
4. Wait for this workflow to complete (it should show a green checkmark)
5. Return to Settings > Pages
6. You should see a message saying "Your site is published at https://yourusername.github.io/car-marketplace/"
7. Click this link to visit your live site

## Troubleshooting

If your site isn't working correctly:

1. Check the Actions tab to see if there are any errors in the deployment workflow
2. Ensure all file paths in your HTML/CSS/JS are relative, not absolute
3. Make sure image paths are correct
4. Check for any 404 errors in your browser's developer console
